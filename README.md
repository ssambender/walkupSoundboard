# Walkup Soundboard
A local-based audio streaming interface designed to save song orders, and start times, to easily play walkup songs. 

## How to set up
- Create a folder/dir anywhere on your computer
- Drag the **index.html** and **favicon.png** _(optional)_ in that created folder
- Add any songs/sounds you may want to include in the soundboard in the same folder
- Launch **index.html** and under the EDIT SONGS window on the right, click ADD and then choose the files!

## Future features
- Custom labels & file renaming
- Fade in/out options
- Show the song's total length next to the START AT option
- Add an END AT option
- Drag and drop reordering of the songs on the soundboard
- Export your START AT and END AT times for each song so walkup setlists can be saved as ZIPs
